# 338-dirtydata

Name of project: drtE (Project 10: Automated Data Cleaning)

Description of the project:
Our project will look at how to identify problems at the data level and report on them. We hope to speed up the workflow of data scientists and allow them to focus on their actual analysis of the data without having to worry about outliers, improper formatting, misplaced cells, messy data etc. Or at the very least will make their role easier by informing them where the potential errors are. This will not only make them more productive but also help with accurately rectifying errors in the data layer.

What we hope this project will accomplish: we hope to speed up the workflow of data scientists and allow them to focus on their actual analysis of the data without having to worry about outliers, improper formatting, misplaced cells, etc. Or at the very least will make their role easier by informing them where the potential errors are. This will not only make them more productive but also help with accurately rectifying errors in the data layer.

Initial approach: Our initial approach would be to clean data with incorrect formatting, typos, duplicated, incomplete or flawed text. i.e looking for data completeness and consistency
Selection of a dataset (Yelp, Airbnb)
Understanding the dataset and its context (data types/attributes present in the dataset)
Identifying problems that can be solved using the dataset
Extraction of data from the source
